# Rhythm-test
Assignment project implementing a rhythm test program with input validation, response timing, and results summary.

# Project Overview
This project was developed as part of an individual programming assignment. The task was to design and implement a Rhythm Test program in Python, testing the user’s ability to maintain consistent timing when pressing the Enter key.

The program demonstrates the use of:
* Variables, data types, and input/output
* Selection and iteration structures
* Lists for data storage
* Functions with parameters and return values
* Basic error handling and validation

# Learning Objectives

The purpose of this assignment was to apply foundational programming concepts by:

* Designing and implementing a Python program from a problem description.
* Applying loops and conditional statements for input validation.
* Using the time library to measure real-time user responses.
* Implementing a custom function (rate_rhythm) to evaluate performance.
* Producing meaningful program output with both summary and detailed breakdowns.

# Program Functionality

The Rhythm Test program allows the user to:

* Select a rhythm speed (1, 2, or 3 seconds).
* Choose the number of rounds (between 5 and 50).
* Perform the rhythm test by pressing Enter according to the chosen rhythm.
* View per-round results, including:
* Response time
* Deviation from target (early/late/spot on)
* Performance rating (“Great!”, “Okay!”, “Miss!”)
* At the end, view a summary showing:
  - Fastest response time
  - Average response time
  - Slowest response time
